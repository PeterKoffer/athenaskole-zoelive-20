## Subject Coverage

All subjects now follow this standard:
- ✅ **English**: Grammar and Word Usage
- ✅ **Mathematics**: Addition and Number Patterns  
- ✅ **Science**: Living Things and Environment
- ✅ **Music**: Rhythm, Melody, and Expression
- ✅ **Computer Science**: Computational Thinking
- ✅ **Creative Arts**: Visual Arts and Expression

## AI/UX Requirements Met

✅ **Supportive, Adaptive Tone**: EnhancedTeachingEngine provides encouraging responses
✅ **Immediate Feedback**: All interactive elements provide instant, constructive feedback  
✅ **Personalized Learning**: Difficulty and responses adapt based on student performance
✅ **Dynamic Experience**: Conversational, not static presentation
✅ **Consistent Structure**: All subjects follow identical timing and phase structure

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { createStandardLesson, StandardLessonConfig } from './StandardLessonTemplate';

const myLessonConfig: StandardLessonConfig = {
  subject: 'mathematics',
  skillArea: 'Fractions and Decimals',
  // ... other configuration
};

const lesson = createStandardLesson(myLessonConfig);
// Returns perfectly timed 20-minute lesson with all 6 phases
```

## Validation

```typescript
import { validateAllLessons } from './LessonValidator';

const validation = validateAllLessons();
// Checks all subjects meet the 20-minute standard
```

This standardized structure ensures every student receives a consistent, engaging, and adaptive 20-minute learning experience across all subjects.
