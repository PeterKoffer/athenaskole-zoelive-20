# Product & Pedagogy

## Vision: A Flexible Educational Simulator + Tutor

The app is not just Q&A—it’s an engine for **immersive learning**:
- Learners face **realistic scenarios** with messy, competing priorities.
- They make decisions, manage resources, see consequences, and **debrief**.
- The goal is to bridge theory ↔ practice, building **critical thinking** and **real-world skills**.

## Core Principles

- **Active, Experiential Learning**: learning-by-doing with immediate feedback.
- **Safe-to-Fail**: risk without real-world cost encourages exploration.
- **Debrief is King**: analytics + data support rich reflection after play.
- **Realism & Ambiguity**: authentic constraints and trade-offs.
- **Emotional Engagement**: urgency/competition boost retention.

## NELIE: The In-App Tutor

NELIE is the always-on guide that:
- Knows user profile (grade, ability, learning style, interests)
- Adjusts difficulty and modality on the fly
- Provides explanations, hints, and metacognitive prompts
- Can converse via text/voice
- Logs actions for progress and debrief

## Two Learning Modes

- **Universe**: story-driven worlds with characters/locations that frame tasks.
- **Training Ground**: structured practice with templates, fast feedback, and mastery tracking.

## Platform Capabilities (now & next)

- **Scenario Builder** (planned): roles, branching decision trees, resource mgmt, dynamic events.
- **Analytics & Dashboards** (in progress): actions, outcomes, KPIs, heatmaps.
- **Team Play** (planned): cooperative/competitive classroom sessions.
- **LMS Integration** (planned): Canvas, Blackboard—rosters and gradebook.
- **Multimedia** (available): images/audio/video hooks ready to incorporate.

## Example Simulation Blueprints

- **Marketing: Product Launch** — segmentation, positioning, budget allocation
- **Leadership: Crisis Management** — decision-making under pressure, comms, ethics
- **Entrepreneurship: Startup Game** — opportunity recognition, prototyping, fundraising

## Performance & Cost Strategy

- Pre-generate daily content at startup or in the background.
- Stream responses and cache aggressively.
- Maintain a large **fallback pool** (≥ 500 days) to guarantee instant delivery.
- Abstract provider calls to support **post-launch provider swap**.
