# NELIE Curriculum Coverage Tracking

This document tracks the status of curriculum data across all NELIE subjects, countries, and grade levels to ensure comprehensive coverage and avoid gaps. It reflects the content currently present in the `src/data/curriculum/` directory.

## Coverage Status Legend
- ‚ùå **Not Started**: No data exists in `src/data/curriculum/`
- üü° **Basic Structure**: Country/Subject/Grade level root node exists.
- üü† **In Progress**: Some Domains and/or Learning Objectives (LOs) added.
- üü¢ **Detailed**: Multiple Domains, LOs, and some Knowledge Components (KCs) added.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive**: Fully detailed with rich metadata and subject-specific fields (aspirational for mock data).

## Priority Expansion Areas (General - based on current minimal data)

### High Priority (Foundation Skills for existing data)
1. **US Math K-1**: Add KCs, detail more domains/LOs per Common Core.
2. **US ELA K-1**: Add KCs, detail more domains/LOs per Common Core.
3. **Danish Matematik & Dansk**: Specify grade levels (e.g., Indskoling 0-3), add more LOs/KCs based on F√¶lles M√•l.

### Medium Priority (Broaden initial coverage)
1. **US Science K-2**: Add initial structure (Subject, Course, Domains, sample LOs) based on NGSS.
2. **US Math/ELA Grade 2**: Add initial structure.
3. **Denmark Indskoling (0-3)**: Broaden subject coverage if possible from F√¶lles M√•l.

### Future Expansion
1. **Higher Grades (US & DK)**: Systematically add content for higher grades.
2. **All NELIE Subjects**: Begin populating currently untouched subjects.
3. **Additional Countries**: Expand beyond US and Denmark.

## Quality Standards for "Comprehensive" Status

To achieve ‚úÖ **Comprehensive** status, curriculum data should include:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Country ‚Üí Grade ‚Üí Subject ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Topic ‚Üí Learning Objective ‚Üí Knowledge Component
- **Rich Metadata**: Duration estimates, difficulty levels, tags, prerequisites
- **Subject-Specific Fields**: Math domains, linguistic skills, scientific practices
- **Assessment Information**: Assessment types, success criteria
- **Accessibility**: Cultural considerations, differentiation support
- **Standards Alignment**: Source identifiers from official curriculum documents

## Data Sources Reference

- **US Mathematics**: Common Core State Standards (CCSS)
- **US English Language Arts**: Common Core State Standards (CCSS)
- **US Science**: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) - *Planned for future data*
- **Danish Subjects**: F√¶lles M√•l (Common Goals)
- **General Structure**: NELIE subject taxonomy and node type hierarchy from `src/types/curriculum/`
