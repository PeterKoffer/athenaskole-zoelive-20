# Training Ground Prompt Template

Training Ground is an educational AI platform dedicated to delivering world-class instruction. It dynamically generates lessons, games, interactive activities, and assessments across twelve subject areas. To get the best results, include as many of the following details as you can. Suggested fallbacks are provided if certain information is unavailable.

## Key Parameters for Tailored Lessons

### Subject (Content Area)
Specify the subject so the AI can match the lesson style and activities. **Fallback:** use a neutral academic focus.

### Student Grade Level
Indicate the grade or K–12 level to keep the language and concepts age‑appropriate. **Fallback:** assume a middle-school proficiency level.

### Curriculum Alignment
Include national or state standards or specific objectives so the lesson meets official requirements. **Fallback:** rely on broadly accepted topics and skills for that grade.

### School/Teaching Perspective
Reference your school philosophy or teaching approach, such as Montessori or project‑based learning. **Fallback:** use a balanced, evidence‑based style.

### Lesson Duration
State how long the lesson should run (e.g. 30 minutes). **Fallback:** plan for a standard 30–45 minute class.

### Subject Weight (Content Emphasis)
If some subjects have higher priority, mention it so depth can be adjusted. **Fallback:** treat all subjects equally.

### Calendar Context (Keywords)
Note seasonal themes, holidays, or events to make content timely. **Fallback:** omit time‑specific context.

### Calendar Duration
Describe the broader timeframe or unit the lesson belongs to. **Fallback:** treat the lesson as a stand‑alone session.

### Student Abilities and Proficiency
Outline prior knowledge or performance so the AI can scaffold or extend appropriately. **Fallback:** assume a mixed‑ability class with both support and challenge.

### Learning Style Preferences
Share whether students prefer visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or other modes. **Fallback:** present information in multiple ways.

### Student Interests
Mention hobbies or topics students enjoy to boost engagement. **Fallback:** use generally relatable examples.

### Interactive & Assessment Elements
Request interactive activities or gamified practice along with a short quiz to check understanding. **Fallback:** include at least one activity and a few review questions.

## Example Prompt Template

> "You are a world-class **[Subject]** teacher creating a lesson for a **[Grade Level]** student. Develop a lesson aligned with **[Curriculum Standards or Objectives]** and incorporate the school's **[Teaching Perspective]** approach. The lesson should be designed for about **[Lesson Duration]** of learning. Since **[Subject]** is a **[high/medium/low]** priority subject in our curriculum, adjust the depth accordingly. Consider the context of **[Calendar Keywords]** over the next **[Calendar Duration]** in the lesson content. Tailor the material to the student's skill level – **[describe Student Ability Level]**, providing support or extension as needed. Use a **[Learning Style]** approach and connect to the student's interest in **[Student Interests]** to make the lesson engaging. Include interactive activities or a game, and end with a brief quiz or test to assess understanding."

## Why These Parameters Matter

Personalizing lessons to each learner's abilities, interests, and curriculum requirements keeps students motivated and ensures progress at the right pace. Interactive elements and end-of-lesson quizzes reinforce knowledge and provide immediate feedback.
